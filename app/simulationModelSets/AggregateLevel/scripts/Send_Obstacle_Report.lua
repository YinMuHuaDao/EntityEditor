-- This script template has each of the script entry point functions.
-- They are described in detail in VR-Forces Configuration Guide.

-- Some basic VRF Utilities defined in a common module.
require "vrfutil"

-- Global Variables. Global variables get saved when a scenario gets checkpointed.
-- They get re-initialized when a checkpointed scenario is loaded.

-- Task Parameters Available in Script
--  taskParameters.area Type: SimObject - Select the Obstacle to report on


-- Called when the task first starts. Never called again.
function init()
   -- Set the tick period for this script.
   vrf:setTickPeriod(0.5)
end

-- Called each tick while this task is active.
function tick()
   vrf:sendReport("spot-report", {spotter_name=this, engagement_result=taskParameters.engagementResult, use_ground_truth=true,
      contact_info={contact_name=taskParameters.obstacleArea, contact_type=taskParameters.obstacleArea:getEntityType()}})
   -- endTask() causes the current task to end once the current tick is complete. tick() will not be called again.
   -- Wrap it in an appropriate test for completion of the task.
   vrf:endTask(true)
end

-- Called when this task is being suspended, likely by a reaction activating.
function suspend()
   -- By default, halt all subtasks and other entity tasks started by this task when suspending.
   vrf:stopAllSubtasks()
   vrf:stopAllTasks()
end

-- Called when this task is being resumed after being suspended.
function resume()
   -- By default, simply call init() to start the task over.
   init()
end
-- Called immediately before a scenario checkpoint is saved when
-- this task is active.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function saveState()
end

-- Called immediately after a scenario checkpoint is loaded in which
-- this task is active.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function loadState()
end

-- Called when this task is ending, for any reason.
-- It is typically not necessary to add code to this function.
function shutdown()
end

-- Called whenever the entity receives a text report message while
-- this task is active.
--   message is the message text string.
--   sender is the SimObject which sent the message.
function receiveTextMessage(message, sender)
